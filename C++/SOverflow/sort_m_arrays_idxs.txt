Rather than sort the arrays, sort the indices. I.e., you have

int arr[5]={4,1,3,6,2}
string arr1[5]={"a1","b1","c1","d1","e1"};

and you make

int indices[5]={0,1,2,3,4};

now you make a sort indices comparator that looks like this 
(just and idea, you''ll probably have to fix it a little)

class sort_indices
{
   private:
     int* mparr;
   public:
     sort_indices(int* parr) : mparr(parr) {}
     bool operator()(int i, int j) const { return mparr[i]<mparr[j]; }
}

now you can use the stl sort

std::sort(indices, indices+5, sort_indices(arr));
